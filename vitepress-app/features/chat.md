## 👥 Multi-User Support

### Per-User Memory

## 🧠 Memory Building Tips

Building memory systematically when first using KIRA makes it much more effective.

### Information to Remember

**Team Member Info:**
```
User: @KIRA Remember our team members
      @John Doe @Jane Smith @Bob Lee

KIRA: [Auto-collect via Slack MCP]
      Saved info for 3 team members to memory!
      (email, Slack ID, title, etc.)
```

**Organization structure, project info, Confluence docs** - Pre-loading enables:
- Auto-recognize email addresses without tagging
- Auto-reference project context
- Use information instantly without searching documents

::: tip Detailed Guide
