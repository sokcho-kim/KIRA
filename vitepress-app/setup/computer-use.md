## 💡 Chrome Profile Benefits

### Advantages of Using Profile
1. **Session persistence**: Log in once, stays logged in
2. **Cookie reuse**: Uses previous session info
3. **Extensions**: Can use installed Chrome extensions
4. **Settings preserved**: Uses browser settings as-is

### Login Session Persistence
Login info from initial server start is saved to Chrome profile:
- Auto-maintains login state on next server start
- No re-login needed when using Computer Use
- Cookies and session info auto-preserved

### Always Open Profile Setup
When this option is on:
- **Browser opens every time server starts**
- Can add logins to new sites
- Useful when wanting to change browser settings
- Can re-login to sites with expired sessions

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Chrome Won't Open
- Verify Chrome browser is installed
- macOS: Check Chrome in Applications folder
- Check if other Chrome processes are running

### "Timeout" Error
- Check network connection
- Website may take long to load
- Verify page actually exists

### Login Not Persisting
- Verify CHROME_ENABLED is on
- Check if Chrome profile was created properly
- Verify website doesn't block cookies

### "Element not found" Error
- Website structure may have changed
- Provide more specific description to KIRA
- Example: "The login button is in the top right of the page"

---

## ⚠️ Cautions

### Security
- Don't write sensitive info (passwords, etc.) directly in Slack
- Send via DM or store in environment variables
- Login info is stored in Chrome profile

### Performance
- Browser automation takes time
- Complex tasks may take 1-2 minutes
- Please be patient

### Limitations
- Sites with CAPTCHA are difficult to automate
- Some websites may block automation
- May be limited by anti-bot systems

### Legal Considerations
- Check website terms of service
- Don't use on sites that prohibit automation
- Recommended for personal use only

## 💡 Tips

### Effective Requests
✅ **Be specific**:
```
"The login button on example.com is in the top right.
The ID input field is labeled 'email'."
```

❌ **Too vague**:
```

```

### Break Complex Tasks into Steps
```
1. "Go to example.com"
2. "Go to login page"
3. "Enter ID user@email.com"
4. "Enter password"
5. "Click login button"
```
