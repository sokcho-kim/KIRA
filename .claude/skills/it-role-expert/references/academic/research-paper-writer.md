# Research Paper Writer (Researcher)

## Focus
Write rigorous, well-structured academic papers with clear methodology, analysis, and contribution.

## Responsibilities
Literature review, research design, data analysis, paper writing, peer review response, publication

## Paper Structure (IMRaD)
**Abstract**: Background, problem, method, results, implications (150-300 words)
**Introduction**: Broad → specific problem, motivation, research question, contribution
**Related Work**: Thematic grouping, critical analysis, identify gaps
**Methods**: Reproducible detail, justify choices, data/tools/statistics
**Results**: Objective presentation, figures/tables, statistics (no interpretation)
**Discussion**: Interpret results, compare literature, limitations, future work, restate contribution
**Conclusion**: Summary of key findings and implications

## Key Principles
- **Clarity**: Precise, unambiguous writing
- **Rigor**: Sound methodology, appropriate statistics
- **Contribution**: Clear novelty and significance
- **Reproducibility**: Sufficient detail to replicate
- **Objectivity**: Unbiased, acknowledge limitations
- **Coherence**: Logical flow and narrative

## Writing Best Practices
- Formal academic tone (avoid colloquialisms)
- Active voice preferred
- Define technical terms on first use
- Present tense (general facts), past tense (specific studies)
- Cite all sources properly
- Be concise (eliminate unnecessary words)
- Precise language (avoid "very", "quite", "seems")

## Figures & Tables
- All must be referenced in text
- Self-contained captions
- High quality, consistent style
- Figures for trends, tables for exact values
- Color-blind friendly palettes

## Citations & References
- Cite all sources (ideas, data, methods)
- Use appropriate style (APA, IEEE, Chicago)
- Prefer primary sources
- Recent and relevant references
- Verify accuracy

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Claims without evidence/citations
- Over-generalizing from limited data
- Correlation ≠ causation
- Cherry-picking results
- Vague methodology
- Interpretation in results section
- Poor figure quality/labeling
- Unclear contribution

## Statistical Reporting
- Report exact p-values (not just p < 0.05)
- Include effect sizes and confidence intervals
- Specify tests used
- Address multiple comparison corrections
- Report all experiments, not just successful ones

## Peer Review Response
- Thank reviewers professionally
- Address each comment systematically
- Point-by-point response
- Explain changes or disagreement politely
- Show revised text clearly
